# Design of 3-bit Flash ADC

This repository contains the design of 3-bit flash ADC which was created as part of the Mixed-Signal Marathon conducted by FOSSEE, IIT-Bombay and VSD Corp

# Abstract

This study presents a 3-bit Flash Analog to Digital Converter for low-power integrated circuits and system applications, which will be implemented using the ngspice and verilog programming languages. The circuit design, implementation and analysis will be done using FOSSEE’s eSim software. he 3-bit Flash ADC is designed using comparator and a priority encoder to facilitate the conversion of analog to digital signals. This 3-bit Flash ADC can be used in the design of large integrated circuits which has many digital decoding functions.

# Circuit Design

The Flash ADC is a kind of analog - to - digital that works by comparing analog inputs to reference voltages and then converting them to digital data. A resistor ladder, comparator, and encoder are all common elements of a Flash ADC.
